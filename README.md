# Abstract of a research

The object of study is a Markov chain with values in the set of binary sequences of fixed length. The dynamics of the chain is defined as a random walk on the vertices of a unit cube, the dimension of which coincides with the length of the binary sequence. 

The states of the given chain are unobservable (hidden). The observed values at each moment of time are a set of values of a certain functional from fixed subsets of the binary sequence that describes the current state of the hidden chain.

The aim of the study is to construct estimates of the unknown parameters of the given Markov model using the mathematical apparatus of hidden Markov models and the methods of mathematical statistics. 

The results of the numerical experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods used, in particular, the convergence of the constructed estimates to the true values of the parameters with an increase in the number of observations.

**Keywords:** Markov chain, hidden Markov model, Baum-Welch algorithm, Viterbi algorithm.

# How to use Python code?

The software of problem-solving algorithms was implemented using ```Python``` tools. Besides, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to effectively process algorithms implementation. 

Follow a ```Diploma research/Algorithm implementation``` folder. You may find algorithms implementation and GUI in a ```HMM.py``` and ```GUI.py``` files respectively. In order to run those files check if you have the following libraries installed:

- ```PySimpleGUI```
- ```random, numpy, scipy, pandas```
- ```matplotlib, cv2```
- ```__future__, typing``` 
- ```itertools```
- ```numda```

# How to use $\LaTeX$ code?

Just a few steps to follow:
1. Install $\LaTeX$ (including ```tikz``` and ```pgfplots``` packages) on your local machine;
2. Clone a repository or download it as a ZIP file;
3. Run a ```Diploma research/Diploma thesis/Tsybulnyk diploma thesis.tex``` file.

Congratulations! Now you can easily discover $\LaTeX$ code!
